                            <p>Hello I am Liam, the founder of Cutting Edge Blades alongside Bill the Co-founder. we came up with the idea for this company when we were in our early collage career in 2005. It started out small just me and Bill making knives out of wood and metal in our dads garage. we realised we could take this further so we created Cutting Edge Blades and went from there.</p>

We also hope to someday open up in person stores to allow customers to feel and hold our knives before they purchase them to ensure optimal comfort for the user. </p>
